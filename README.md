# Socialite

This is an opinionated Rails 3.1 mountable engine provides your application with
support for managing multiple OAuth providers per User.

## Why make this?

Every site I have built in the past couple years has required implementing
authentication support for Users. Now this was simple enough when it was only
**one** provider (in my case, "Login with Facebook"), but more often then not
it evolved into "Login with `<insert_oauth_provider>`".

Now OmniAuth has some [good write-ups](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/Managing-Multiple-Providers)
on handling multiple providers, but it lacked any support for restricting a user
to one identity per provider. Socialite aims to solve this and while enforcing
every user to have a Basic Authentication identity as a fall-back in case of
password recovery.

## What makes this unique?

1. Every User can only have one identity per supported provider
  * Example: User can have only 1 linked Facebook Identity at any given time
2. Every User must have an basic-auth identity
  * Example: User signs up through Facebook, but unlinks it.
    Enforcing a local basic auth mechanism aids account recovery.
3. Supports any provider strategy in the OmniAuth project.

  installs and `rails g active_record:socialite` for specifying custom options.

## History

This project began as a fork of [Tim Riley](http://openmonkey.com)'s
great Omnisocial plugin. The motivation for this fork is that I required
multiple authorizations for each account (linking support) and wanted a
proper mountable Rails 3.1 Engine.
